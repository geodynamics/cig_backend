DESCRIPTION OF BACKEND DATA

Written by Eric Heien on Apr 15, 2013

This directory contains scripts and data related to the backend management of the
CIG website. This includes things such as download hit records and map generation,
bibliography list data and generation, automated documentation generation, and
automated build testing for the CIG codes.

Each directory contains a README file describing the contents and function in
detail. Here is a brief overview of the directories:

doxygen/
    Contains scripts to generate doxygen based documentation of the different CIG
    codes based either on released source or a repository checkout.  Relevant URL
    as of Apr 15, 2013
        http://geodynamics.org/~emheien/doxygen/

map/
    Contains databases, scripts and related files for tracking downloads of software
    distributions from the website, and creating maps to display downloads.  Relevant
    URL as of Apr 15, 2013
	    http://geodynamics.org/~buildbot/maps/

queue/
     Contains script to allow queueing of commands. This is primarily used for the
     doxygen documentation where we want to avoid possible overwriting and
     misordering.

ref_list/
    Contains databases and scripts to record references to papers which used CIG
    codes, and generate a publicly viewable (and eventually searchable) web page
    of these papers.  Relevant URL as of Apr 15, 2013
