DESCRIPTION OF HIT MAPPING TOOLS

Written by Eric Heien on Apr 15, 2013

This directory contains scripts and data related to recording downloads of CIG
software and creating maps of the download activity. This directory contains three
subdirectories (described below) with files pertaining to the three steps of this
functionality:

    1) analyze Apache logs and record hits in a SQLite database (hit_database/)

    2) generate SQLite database mapping IP addresses to latitude/longitude locations
    (ip_database/)

    3) use the two aforementioned databases with GMT to create maps of download
    activity (map_plot/)

Descriptions of the subdirectories and their files

ip_database/

    generate_ip_database.py
    Requires at least Python 2.6, compatible with Python 3.3.

    Simple Python script to read csv files and convert them to a SQLite
    database. Usage is:

        generate_ip_database.py DB_NAME LOCATION_CSV_FILE BLOCK_CSV_FILE

    GeoLiteCity-Blocks.csv, GeoLiteCity-Location.csv
	CSV files downloaded from http://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geolite with
	information for mapping IP addresses to latitude/longitude coordinates.
	These are parsed by the generate_ip_database.py script to create a SQLite3
	database. An example of running these through the script:

    ./generate_ip_database.py ip_lookup_db GeoLiteCity-Location.csv GeoLiteCity-Blocks.csv

    Read 409857 entries from file and added 409857 entries to location table.

    (Optional: ip_lookup_db or another database name) SQLite3 database containing
    the converted CSV file contents.
