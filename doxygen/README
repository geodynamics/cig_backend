DESCRIPTION OF AUTOMATED DOXYGEN DOCUMENT GENERATION

Written by Eric Heien on May 1, 2013

This directory contains scripts to generate documentation for CIG codes using the
Doxygen documentation system.

generate_doxygen.sh
    The main documentation generation script.
	Usage: generate_doxygen.sh <method> <URL> <revision> <project name>

	<method> specifies the method of retrieving a copy of the source, this can
	be one of "git, url". The first three refer to developer
	documentation, the last one to released source documentation.

	<URL> specifies the URL to get the source from. The meaning and proper
	format of this will depend on which method is used.

	<revision> specifies either the revision number of the source to create
	documentation for (for developer documentation) or the release number (for
	release documentation). Again, the proper format of this will depend on
	which method is used. For git it must be a hash and for url it must be a
    version number like X.XX.

    <project name> specifies the name of the project which determines the directory
    name the code will be put in.

queue_doxygen.py
    Script to help automate queueing of doxygen generation requests.
    Usage: queue_doxygen.py <code_name|all> <release|dev>

    The first argument specifies whether to generate documentation for a particular
    code or all codes. The list of codes is specified in the cig_codes.py module
    in the parent directory.

    The second argument specifies whether to generate documentation based on the
    release code or repository development code.

template.doxyfile
    A doxyfile to specify how the documentation is generated. However, this doxyfile
    is incomplete in that several parts consist of keywords which are replaced by
    sed commands in generate_doxygen.sh to create a valid doxyfile.


Directories which may exist:

repos/
    Contains checked out versions of the development source. Since checking out
    the entire code may take a long time, the generate_doxygen.sh script checks
    out the code once and updates it to the current revision. This drastically
    improves speeds and avoids wasting bandwidth.

tmp/####
    Temporary directories (number specified by process ID) where the magic happens.
    Used to hold temporary files, logs, etc. These should be deleted automatically
    when the script finishes or is cancelled.

doxygen/
    Contains copies of the generated doxygen documentation.

queue/
    Contains queue related files including commands (formed as SUBMISSIONTIME_PID)
    and lockfiles.
